# Noughts-and-Crosses-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
This is a Python implementation of the classic game Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize performance.

🚀 Features
Supports human vs. AI and AI vs. AI modes.
Uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for better decision-making and faster performance.
Clean and structured code for easy understanding and modification.
🧠 How It Works
Minimax Algorithm – The AI evaluates all possible moves and selects the best one.
Alpha-Beta Pruning – Reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm by pruning branches that cannot affect the outcome.
🎮 How to Play
Start the game.
Choose whether you want to play as 'X' or 'O'.
The AI will calculate the optimal move using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
Try to win or force a draw!
🏆 Future Improvements
Add a graphical interface (using tkinter or pygame).
Introduce difficulty levels by adjusting search depth.
Add support for multiplayer over a network.
